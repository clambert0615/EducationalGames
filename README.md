# Educational Games

## Introduction

This program provides educational games for students.  Students can log in and play math and science games.  Students, parents and teachers can log in and view the student's 
statistics for each game as well as the class average.  The site implements identity framework and user roles, so once logged in the person is directed to the correct menu based on
their role.  The student index leads the student to choose from math games, science games, or to view their statistics.  The administration menu provides the user with all of the
administrartive functions (see screenshot). The parent menu allows parents to see a list of their students with additional detailed information including teacher name and email and the student's
progress report.  Teachers can log in and see all of the students in their class along with a progress report for each student with class averages.  Teachers can also view 
additional student information including parent name and contact information.
